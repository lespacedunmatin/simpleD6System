# simpleD6System
A try to build a simple D6 RPG system. It is intended to be understandable by a 10 years old child.

Core principle is "roll a certain amount of D6 (attribute), keep the best, add skill level, dices with same number are
bonuses. Match the requested difficulty, excess points give the quality of the success". 

## difficulty scale

5: easy
6: normal
8: hard
10: impossible

## Examples
my character is quite smart with an attribute *intelligence* of 3, and has a skill 2 in *investigation*. I roll 3D6 against
a difficulty of 6, get [1 1 5]: I keep the 5, add 2 for the skill, and an other 2 for the pair of ones, giving me a
result of 9, outstanding success!

A dragon tries to rip a wall, he has 5 in *strength* and a *mass destruction* skill of 4. He rolls against a difficulty of
10, and gets [3 3 3 5 5]: he gets 5 (best score) + 4 (skill) + 2 (the pair of 5) + 3 (the three 3) = 14. There is a
huge breach in the wall, the undeads are coming!
