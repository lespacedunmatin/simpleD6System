- light wounds: stamina attribute. Each 2 wound adds a -1 to the skill (round down).
- critical wounds: half the stamina (round down, can be zero if stamina is 1). Each wound reduces the attributes by 1.
- dying. Player is unable to act.

### Attacking and defending

Characters rolls under *strength* with adequate skill under a difficulty of 6. Attacker quality is removed defender quality.
